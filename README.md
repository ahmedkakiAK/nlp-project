# NLP Fake News Classification Project

This project was developed as part of the **Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing** course. It explores and compares several deep learning approaches for fake news classification using text data. The models implemented range from classical RNN-based architectures to Transformers and zero-shot classification.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

We use two publicly available datasets for fake news detection:

- [ISOT Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets)
- [Kaggle: Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/fake-or-real-news)

Raw data is located in the `data/raw` folder. It is preprocessed using `preprocess_data.py` and stored in the `data/processed` folder as training and test splits.
